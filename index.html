                <p class="para">Effective communication is crucial for a business to succeed. Be it external or internal, it showcases the business’ persona to the world. But handling such a crucial task of 'perfecting the words' can prove tedious and time-consuming. Valuable time that can be spent on other tasks that can improve your business. </p>
                
                <p class="para">So it’s always best to leave the art of perfecting your business writing in the hands of a professional writing tool like Zoho Writer that has zero tolerance for errors and can help your executives (including your writers) communicate better with the world. </p>
                <p class="para">Here are 5 reasons for using Zoho Writer - if you are not already using it.</p>
                <br/>
                
                <p class="para special"><b>1.

                <p class="para special"><b>5.	Multi Device and Offline Support:</b> Zoho Writer allows businesses to write across devices - be it laptop, smartphone or tab.

            <section id="why">
                <h2 class="header2" id="new"><b>New to Zoho Writer? Here's What You Need to Know</b></h2>
                <p class="para">Zoho Writer is not just a word processing tool. It’s not just for aspiring authors or content writing teams. It’s much more than that. It can help businesses improve their communication with the outside world and thereby increase their business. </p>
                <p class="para">So let’s take a look at some of the features that set Zoho Writer apart from being just another word processor that only helps writers churn out quality content. </p>
                <p class="para special"><b>1. It Helps You Create Interactive Documents:</b> Interactive documents that require some form of user input like questionnaires, feedback forms, surveys etc., can be easily created using fillable documents within Zoho Writer. You can leverage this feature to listen to what your customers have to say and bring in the necessary changes that improve your business.</p>
                <p class="para special"><b>2. It Helps You Automate Document Workflows:</b> Business document workflows like sending out bulk emails, creating content common to a group of recipients, mailing documents to be signed by employees etc., can be easily automated using Zoho Writer. </p>
                <p class="para special"><b>3. It Helps You Use Import Custom Fields:</b> Every organization has its own set of terms when it comes to creating its official documents. With this in mind, the creators of Zoho Writer offer you the option of importing your custom fields in the form of .csv or .json files. </p>
                <p class="para special"><b>4. It Works Offline:</b> The most important benefit which Zoho Writer offers that sets it apart from its competitors like Google Docs and Microsoft Word is the fact that it allows its users to work in offline mode.

                <h2 class="header2" id="auto"><b>Automation in Zoho Writer</b></h2>
                <p class="para">Automation in Zoho Writer refers to the task of automating your document workflows. For example, let's say you are a recruiting agency that hires hundreds of employees for your clients. This means mailing out hundreds of candidate application forms (each with different sets of form fields),  depending on your client's needs.   </p>
                <p class="para">What if you could automate such a tedious task of manually creating those client-specific form fields? Well, with Zoho Writer, you could do just that - and much more.</p>
                <p class="para">Zoho Writer offers 3 types of automation:</p>
                <br />
                <p class="para special"><b>1. Merge Templates</b>: This is what we just talked about. The ability to prefill your documents with client-specific jargon or lingo or simply 'field names' unique to the client. They are called 'merge templates' because you are basically 'merging' or 'importing' client-specific fields into your existing Zoho Writer form templates. </p>
                <p class="para special">This import can happen from one of the following data sources: csv files or json files or Zoho Contacts or Zoho Sheet or Zoho Forms or Zoho Creator or Zoho CRM, depending on where you choose to store your client information. </p>

                <br />
                <p class="para special"><b>2. Fillable Templates</b>: While working with clients, you have to get their feedback from time to time to understand whether you are meeting their requirements or not. So you need survey forms or questionnaires to accomplish this. Again, this means different sets of forms or questionnaires for different sets of clients.</p>
                <p class="para special">Creation and distribution of such 'fillable forms or questionnaires' too can be automated using 'fillable templates' in Zoho Writer, rather than having to create them manually for each and every client.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="para special"><b>3. Sign Templates</b>: 'Sign Collection' is integral to documentation workflows. It could be the signature of the new hire or a top-level executive that needs to be collected to finish off a particular document's workflow. It's best to automate the contents of these documents because they usually have to be distributed to several people with the same content.</p>
                <p class="para special">Using 'Sign Templates' of Zoho Writer, you can easily automate the creation and distribution of such sign collection documents, removing the need for having to create them manually. </p>
                <br />
                <p class="para">Now that you know how automation in Zoho Writer can make your lives easier. Go ahead and incorporate them into your organization's documentation workflows and improve your business.</p>
